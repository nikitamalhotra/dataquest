    "There are some files that change very often, and aren't particularly useful to a project. One example is the .DS_Store file OS X puts in directories. Another is the .pyc files that Python produces when it compiles source files. Neither of these are necessary for the project to work properly, but because they change rapidly, they can create merge conflicts and other problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to handle these types of files is to tell Git to ignore them. That means Git won't add them to commits or track them, so we won't have to deal with merge conflicts and other issues they may cause.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we create a file called <font color=\"red\">.gitignore</font>. Then, we add lines to it indicating which files Git should ignore when adding to the staging area and committing. These lines accept wildcard characters, so we can ignore all files that have a certain extension in a single line.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following lines in .gitignore instruct Git to ignore all files called .DS_Store, and all files ending with .pyc:\n",

    ".DS_Store<br>\n",
    "*.pyc\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've included those lines, Git won't add new files named .DS_Store or that end in .pyc to the staging area. It also won't commit them in future commits. It will still track changes to existing files it's already added to a commit, however, and also continue adding them to new commits.\n",
